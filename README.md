Project Overview:


As a caregiver to a special need’s son, I can say this type of application has a potential to help in providing care for patients. The future development will consist of an online portal and user database to track care provided and allow for patient note sharing between caregivers. This could be implemented using website or an installable app for phone and tablet. Due to scope and time constraints, these features will be left out of this project. This program is designed with simplicity as a feature. When caregivers go about the daily duties it is nice to have a time saving application that is simplified in use.

Patient Daily Medical Care Plan will help in the scheduling of a patient’s daily care. With simplicity of use in mind for the design, this scheduling application will allow for multiple care givers to coordinate care to a single patient. The Care giver must input initial feed time allowing the software to calculate additional feed times, medication schedule and activity schedule for the day. Using a centralized scheduler would prevent missed feedings and medication dispensing resulting in a more uniformed care for patient. This is accomplished with a user interface that displays a window broken down into areas of activities. Activity areas are labeled as Feed Times, Medication Times, Exercise Times, and Entertainment Times. There is also a field for Start Feed Time to be entered by the caregiver. This field when entered will populate the other fields with the daily schedule. Figure 1 shows basic window layout. Figure 2 is a flowchart of operation and figure 3 highlights area for user input.
